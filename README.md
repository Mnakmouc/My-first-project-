# My First Webpage – Personal Introduction

Welcome to my personal webpage! 🚀  
This is a simple HTML website I built to introduce myself, share my hobbies, talk about my hometown Larache, show my weekly study schedule, and provide a way to contact me.

## Features

- **Header** – Welcome message and short introduction
- **Hobbies** – List of things I enjoy (football, driving, swimming, horse‑riding)
- **Hometown** – A short description of Larache, Morocco, with a link to Wikipedia
- **Weekly Schedule** – Table displaying my university classes
- **Contact Form** – Basic form with name, email, subject selection, and message
- **Multimedia** – Embedded YouTube video and an audio player

## Built With

- HTML5 – semantic elements like `<header>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`
- No CSS or JavaScript yet – pure HTML structure

## Live Demo

You can view the page live on GitHub Pages:  
[https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/](https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/)  
*(enable Pages in your repo settings after pushing)*

*This is my first step into front‑end development. Feedback is always welcome!*
